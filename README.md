Multi-user chat system (Total points: 45)
You are required to design and implement a multi-user chat system that is like
a real-time instant message board system, much like IRC. The users should be
able to talk to one another and to everyone else. The system needs to make
sure which message is meant for whom – for individual user or for everyone.
The message meant for everyone should be flashed on the system for everyone
to view. The messages meant for individual users need to be handled for the
individual users themselves.
You may user popular Linux IPC mechanism for the same. For now, please
ignore synchronization/race-condition prevention.

What To Submit
• Program source code with Makefile
• Write-up describing the following:
– Description of your code and how you implemented the function –
the logical and implementation details.
– Description of how to compile and test the program
– The inputs the user should give.
– Expected output (and how to interpret it).
– Error values and how to interpret them.

Grading Rubric
• Successful compilation your the program – 10 points.
• Correct functioning of the chat system for multi-users – 20 points.
• Correct handling of input errors (atleast two different types of errors
should be handled) – 10 points.
• Description of the systems, test cases etc. – 5 points.
